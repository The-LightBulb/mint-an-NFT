# mint-an-NFT
This is an example of a simple smart contract for minting a NFT on a test network

First step is to set up the local tools. In this example I used hardhat.
Then I get a sample project working.

For this project I also used Alchemy and MetaMask to deploy to Rinkeby and see it on OpenSea



Part II of this Project was about creating a web dApp (with React) to show them.
I added the JS File for the dApp
I created a folder utils for the .api file where I copied the code in a file named MyEpicNFT.json
